# Assignment 4

**Implement a compiler for the `Lif` language with `if` statements by
modifying the `compiler.py` file in the `a4` directory of the
[assignments repository](https://github.com/jnear/cs202-assignments)
and submit your `compiler.py` file on the course Blackboard under
"Assignment 4".**

**Due: Monday, Mar 21, 11:59pm**

Complete `compiler.py` so that it implements a compiler from the `Lif`
language to x86 assembly. Your compiler does not need to handle *if
expressions* (only `if` statements).
