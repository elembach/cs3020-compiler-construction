# Assignment 3

**Solve the exercise(s) by modifying the `compiler.py` file in the `a3`
directory of the [assignments
repository](https://github.com/jnear/cs202-assignments) and submit
your `compiler.py` file on the course Blackboard under "Assignment
3".**

**Due: Monday, March 8, 11:59pm**

Extend your compiler from Assignment 2 to perform register
allcation. Your new compiler should handle the same source language as
Assignment 2, but should be reasonably good at assigning registers.

In addition to the exercises you solved in Assignment 2, you will need
to solve:

- Exercise 11

**Challenge exercise**: Solve exercise 12: modify your
  `allocate-registers` pass to take move biasing into account.

**Note**: if you are an undergraduate student, and you solve the
  challenge exercise for extra credit, please note this in a comment
  at the top of your file.
