# UVM CS202: Compiler Construction (Spring 2023)

## Administrative

- **Lecture**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 10:50 - 11:40am, Perkins Hall 107
- **Instructor**: Joe Near (jnear at uvm dot edu)
- **Office hours**: 9:30am - 10:30am, Monday and Friday, Innovation Hall E458

## Course Description

This course covers the design and construction of compilers. You'll
learn how to translate a high-level, garbage-collected programming
language all the way into Intel x86 assembly language.

Instead of learning about each phase of the compilation process
sequentially, we'll start by compiling a tiny subset of the target
language directly into assembly code. Each week, we'll add a new
feature to our language, and learn about all the phases needed to
compile that feature into assembly. At each step, you'll have a
functioning compiler that can run real code; by the end of the course,
your compiler will work on a realistic programming language including
first-class functions.

Topics covered include:

- representation and analysis of code
- register allocation
- static type checking
- mutable data
- garbage collection
- first-class functions and closure conversion

This course will be structured around lectures and a weekly
programming assignment. Each lecture will cover a new language feature
and the techniques needed to compile it; in the corresponding
programming assignment, you will implement support for the new feature
in your own compiler. Students should expect to spend 6-8 hours per
week outside of class on the weekly programming assignments. The
required materials for this course are all freely available online.

Students will also complete a final project, in which they extend
their compiler with an additional significant language feature of
their choice.

Graduate students are expected to complete additional *challenge
exercises* included in each assignment, and to select more ambitious
final projects compared to undergraduate students.

This course is primarily intended for computer science students, but
may also be appropriate for some graduate students in other areas with
an interest in programming languages and strong programming
experience.

Prerequisites: CS124 and CS125

# Policies

## Grading

Your grade for the course will be determined as follows:

- 7 homework assignments (8% each; 56% total)
- 7 self-review assignments (4% total)
- in-class weekly exercises (20% total)
- final project (10%)
- midterm exam (5%)
- final exam (5%)

Your final grade will be determined by summing the total number of
points awarded and calculating the percentage of the total possible
points. This percentage is translated into a letter grade as follows:

### Undergraduate Students

| Percent | Letter Grade |
| ------: | ------------ |
| 98-100  | A+           |
| 93-97   | A            |
| 90-92   | A-           |
| 87-89   | B+           |
| 83-86   | B            |
| 80-82   | B-           |
| 77-79   | C+           |
| 73-76   | C            |
| 70-72   | C-           |
| 67-69   | D+           |
| 63-66   | D            |
| 60-62   | D-           |
| <60     | F            |

### Graduate Students

| Percent | Letter Grade |
| ------: | ------------ |
| 98-100  | A+           |
| 93-97   | A            |
| 90-92   | A-           |
| 87-89   | B+           |
| 83-86   | B            |
| 80-82   | B-           |

## Assignments

Assignments will generally be due weekly on Mondays at 11:59pm,
with breaks for the midterm exam and final project. Your assignment
will be graded using a test suite which will be made available one day
before the assignment due date.

Late assignments will **not** be accepted. Each assignment builds
extensively on the last one, and mastering the assignment material is
crucial to success in this course. If you fall behind on completing
the assignments, it will be extremely difficult to catch up.

Therefore, on Wednesday after each assignment due date, we will
discuss that assignment's solution in lecture, and the complete
solution will be made available on Blackboard. I encourage students to
take advantage of the official solutions to avoid falling behind.

Partial credit will be (extensively) given on assignments. I encourage
you to submit *something* for every assignment, even if your solution
is far from complete.

Most assignments include a *challenge exercise*, which generally
involves extending your compiler with extra features or optimization
capabilities. Graduate students are required to complete all of the
challenge exercises, and the challenge exercise will account for 20%
of the total grade for the assignment. Undergraduates who successfully
complete the challenge exercise for an assignment will receive 5%
extra credit for that assignment.

Assignments will be graded according to the following rubric:

| Grade | Assignment Status                                         |
| ----: | -------------------                                       |
| 100   | Passes all test cases                                     |
| 95    | Passes 75% of test cases                                  |
| 90    | Passes 50% of test cases                                  |
| 85    | Passes at least 1 test case                               |
| 80    | Project compiles; all passes appear to be nearly complete |
| 75    | All or nearly all passes appear nearly complete           |
| 70    | Significant work on all passes                            |
| 65    | Significant work on at least 75% of the passes            |
| 60    | Significant work on at least half of the passes           |
| <60   | Missing passes                                            |

## Self-Review Assignments

Each homework assignment will have a corresponding *self-review
assignment* due one week later. The self-review assignment is an
opportunity for students to describe and explain the differences
between their solution and the instructor solution.

For each pass of the compiler, your self-review should give short
(1-paragraph) answers for two questions:
- What functionality is missing or broken in your implementation?
- How does your implementation differs from the instructor solution?

If your compiler passes all of the test cases, and correctly
implements the same functionality as the instructor solution, then the
self-review assignment is trivial (the answer to both questions is
"none"), and the self-review assignment is essentially *free points*.

## In-Class Exercise

An *in-class exercise* will be due every Friday at 11:59pm. The
exercises for the week will be released on Monday morning, and we will
complete these exercises together during the lectures each week. If
you attend lectures and follow along, the in-class exercises should
not require significant additional time outside of lecture to
complete.

## Exams

There will be two exams: a midterm and a final. You will be allowed
unlimited pages of notes for each exam. See the schedule below for the dates.

## Final Projects

Each student will select and complete a new language feature for their
compiler. Final project deliverables will consist of a short project
proposal, a compiler implementing the selected language feature, and
test cases demonstrating its use. Final projects may be completed in
teams of up to 3 students; larger teams will be expected to complete
more ambitious projects.

[Click here for more information on final projects](https://jnear.github.io/cs202-compiler-construction/projects).

## Graduate Students

Graduate students will be expected to complete additional requirements
in order to receive graduate credit for this course:

- Graduate students are expected to complete all of the challenge
  exercises. For graduate students, the challenge exercise will
  account for 20% of the assignment's total grade.

- Graduate students are expected to select and complete more ambitious
  final projects. Suggested topics for graduate student final projects
  will be included in the detailed final project information.


## Collaboration & Allowed References

Collaboration on the high-level ideas and approach on assignments is
encouraged. Copying someone else's work (outside of your team
members) is not allowed.

The official references for the course are listed in the schedule
below. Copying from references other than these is not allowed. In
particular, code should not be copied from other sources, including
Stack Overflow and other public sources.

Students caught copying work are eligible for immediate failure of the
course and disciplinary action by the University. All academic
integrity misconduct will be treated according to [UVM's Code of
Academic
Integrity](https://www.uvm.edu/policies/student/acadintegrity.pdf).
